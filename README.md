This is a Express server demo. It pulls API information on characters from the video game Overwatch. It shows both the good, the bad, and the unaligned characters.

You could access them by:
http://localhost:3000
  /overwatch
  /talon
  /unChara
  
If you want the api version:
  /api/overwatch
  /api/talon
  /api/unChara
